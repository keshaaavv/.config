hay limine user.
make sure u werent like me and make sure ur drive is formatted to btrfs.
i didnt. so now i cant use snapper.
and im too lazy to reset.

ANYWHO:

make sure u put limine.conf in your boot directory.

eg;
/boot/EFI/limine.conf or /boot/limine/limine.conf

u can check by doing

- cd /boot
- ls      # check for anything limine related, if its a folder cd into it and do ls again.
